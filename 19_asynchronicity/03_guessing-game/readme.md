# Guessing Game
This is my solution for the Guessing Game project from App Academy Open. The game is played on the console.

## User Stories
The player can:
- Set the number of attempts they want to have.
- Define the **min** and **max** number to set a range for the possible secret number.
- Enter a number as a guess.
- See a message telling them whether their guess was **Too High** or **Too Low**.
- See the number of attempts left for every wrong answer.
- See a message telling them  **Game Over** when they have no attempts left.
- See a message telling them **You Win!** when they guess correctly.

## Usage
To run the game, move to the project folder and type the following command in the console.
```
node guessing-game.js
```
